{"name":"Faraday","tagline":"Collaborative Penetration Test IDE","body":"![Faraday Logo](https://raw.github.com/wiki/infobyte/faraday/images/Faraday-Logo.png)\r\n\r\nFaraday introduces a new concept (IPE) Integrated Penetration-Test Environment a multiuser Penetration test IDE. Designed for distribution, indexation and analysis of the generated data during the process of a security audit.\r\n\r\nThe main purpose of Faraday is to re-use the available tools in the community to take advantage of them in a multiuser way.\r\n\r\nDesigned for simplicity, users should notice no difference between their own terminal application and the one included in Faraday. Developed with a specialized set of functionalities that help users improve their own work. Do you remember yourself programming without an IDE? Well, Faraday does the same as an IDE does for you when programming, but from the perspective of a penetration test.\r\n\r\n![GUI - Web](https://raw.github.com/wiki/infobyte/faraday/images/GUI_Dashboard_new.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![GUI - QT](https://raw.github.com/wiki/infobyte/faraday/images/Faraday-Mainwindow.png)\r\n\r\nPlease read the [RELEASE notes](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/blob/master/RELEASE.md)!\r\n\r\nPlugins list:\r\n---\r\nRight now faraday has more than [40+ supported tools](https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/wiki/Plugin-List), among them you will find: \r\n![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/infobyte/faraday/images/plugins/Plugins.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe following platform are supported - [More information] (https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/wiki/Installation) :\r\n\r\n![platform](https://raw.github.com/wiki/infobyte/faraday/images/platform/supported.png) \r\n\r\n\r\nQuick install:\r\n\r\nDownload the latest tarball by clicking [here] (https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/tarball/master) \r\n\r\nPreferably, you can download faraday by cloning the [Git] (https://github.com/infobyte/faraday) repository:\r\n\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/infobyte/faraday.git faraday-dev\r\n    $ cd faraday-dev\r\n    $ ./install.sh\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nUsage \r\n----- \r\n\r\nTo get started, simply execute faraday and use the new console to start working in the pentest: \r\n\r\n       $ ./faraday.py\r\n    \r\nPlugins types:\r\n---\r\nWe have 3 kind of plugins:\r\n * Plugins that intercept commands (directly detected when you execute commands in the console)  \r\n * Plugins that import file reports (you have to copy the report to $HOME/.faraday/report/[workspacename] and faraday will automatically detect the report, process and added to the HostTree.\r\n * Plugins connectors or online (BeEF, Metasploit, Burp) connect directly with external API or database or connect with Faraday RPC API.   \r\n\r\nGet it now!\r\n---\r\n[![Download Tarball](https://raw.github.com/wiki/infobyte/faraday/images/download.png)]\r\n(https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/tarball/master)\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n---\r\n\r\n* Homepage: http://faradaysec.com\r\n* User's manual: https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/wiki\r\n* Download: [.tar.gz] (https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/tarball/master)\r\n* Commits RSS feed: https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/commits/master.atom\r\n* Issue tracker: https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/issues\r\n* Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/wiki/FAQ\r\n* Mailing list subscription: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/faradaysec\r\n* Twitter: [@faradaysec] (https://twitter.com/faradaysec)\r\n* [Demos] (https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/wiki/Demos)\r\n* IRC: [ircs://irc.freenode.net/faraday-dev] (ircs://irc.freenode.net/faraday-dev)\r\n* Screenshots: https://github.com/infobyte/faraday/wiki/Screenshots\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

**Faraday** (named like that on tribute to the six principles of **Michael Faraday's** scientific discipline) is an **Open Source Penetration test IDE**. It's pretty similar to a **programming IDE** (like Komodo, Eclipse, NetBeans) with the difference that Faraday is for Multiuser Penetration testing purposes. At first sight seems like another IDE, but it's much more than that. It consists of a **Client** and a **Server**, both containing databases. Designed for distributing, indexation and analysis of the generated knowledge during the engagement of a penetration test.

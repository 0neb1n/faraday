Notes
--------

IMPORTANT
===========

Please be kind to remove all your pyc files before running faraday if you are updating this piece of software.  
We made a big refactor in the latest iteration moving some code into a diferent package.


New features in the latest update
=====================================

We are proud to present two new features that will enhace the Faraday experience.
Taking feedback from our users we took account that each of them had particular needs from their consoles (completion, size, fonts, so on so forth)  and their need to be able to know what commands where run during an engagement.

    * A brand new ZSH based Terminal UI
    * The Command Run execution history

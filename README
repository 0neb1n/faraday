[*] What is Faraday?

Faraday introduces a new concept (IPE) Integrated Penetration-Test Environment a multiuser Penetration test IDE. Designed for distribution, indexation and analysis of the generated data during the process of a security audit.

The main purpose of Faraday is to re-use the available tools in the community to take advantages of them in a multiuser way.


[*] Background

Users should not feel any difference between their own terminal application and the one included in Faraday thanks to the simplicity within it, with a specialized set of functionalities that help users improve doing their work.
Do you remember yourself programming without an IDE? Well, Faraday does the same an IDE does for you when programming, but from the perspective of a penetration test.
[*] Usage

From your terminal run:
$ ./faraday

Structured in panes: Main Console, HostTree, Log Console, Item Info & Editing panes.

Every command that you execute is intercepted and a handler is invoked in order to transparently import the newly generated information by the tool in the context of the pentest like ip addresses, hostnames, services, vulnerabilities, websites, notes, etc.

No manual imports needed but supported. Just drop your fresh generated reports in : $ ~/.faraday/report/workspace_name

Faraday imports the imported documents.


[*] Database

By default Faraday uses a local file database. If you like to synchronize with others users you have to configure CouchDB to share information in real time.

The first step is to edit CouchDB config file located in /etc/couchdb/local.ini and set bind_address to the required IP
Restart CouchDB as follows

$ sudo service couchdb restart

In Faraday You have two kind of configuration:
1) Every user uses the same CouchDB database.
Go to Edit->Server Connection to point to the required master for example http://192.168.10.210:5984/.

2) Every user have a own local CouchDB and replicate with a centralize CouchDB Server.
NOTE: If you like to use this configuration check that all CouchDB use almost the version 1.2.0 because some distributions have old version that have some problems.

[*] Workspaces
Information is classified in workspaces units. Each Workspace maps into one/many a pentest assignment/s. Each workspace contains the gathered information for each pentesting assignment. In it you can find all the intel you have discovered.

[*] History

- Introduced to the public at Ekoparty Security Conference 6th Edition on 2010.
- Presented at Blackhat Arsenal 2011
